# Indoor Farming/Greenhouse Data-logger System

This system was designed to assist farmers in third world countries effectively manage farms.

*	Created the “perfect” environmental conditions for optimal maintenance and growth of plants (through remote monitoring).
*	Cost Benefit Analysis of the system showed a Net Benefit of over $7000.00 per year
